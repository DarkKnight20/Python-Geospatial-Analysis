This repository contains three files: one on the boundaries of Washington D.C.'s eight (1-8) Wards (as of 2022), one on the storm surge/risks across the globe (including in D.C.), and one on the flood elevation levels 
in numerous areas (including D.C.) due to flooding
These files are used in part as a geospatial analysis of flood risk in Washington D.C. 
and how that flood risk is unequally distributed across D.C.'s 8 wards (esepcially those of higher economic disadvantage such as 7 and 8)

The code analyzes the files, mapping, visualizing, and organizing data that provides the flood risks and frequencies across the 8 Wards of D.C.
It also includes a social vulnerability analysis using data on poverty rates (data was directly hand-typed into the code during production) to determine which wards in D.C. have the highest social vulnerability
